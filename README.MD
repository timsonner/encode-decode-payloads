# Examples of symetric key encryption/decryption with RC4/AES, base64/hex encoding, and Go/PowerShell  

The idea being Go generates the payloads on the attack box. The victim downloads the PowerShell payloads and runs them in memory via IEX.  

None of the samples here bypass AMSI directly...  

For true obfuscated, encrypted, encoded AMSI bypass, look in ./amsi-bypass
